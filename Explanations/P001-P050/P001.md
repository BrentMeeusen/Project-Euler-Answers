# P001 - Multiples of 3 or 5
You are asked to find the sum of all natural numbers that are multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
The natural numbers are positive integers. Some people include 0, some don't. In this case, it doesn't matter.
Numbers below 1000 means **less than**, not **less than or equal**.
So, find all numbers between 1 and 999, check if they're divisible by 3 or 5 (or both), and sum them up!
