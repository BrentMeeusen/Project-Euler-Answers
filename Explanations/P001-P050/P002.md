# P002 - Even Fibonacci Numbers
The Fibonacci sequence is formed by adding the two previous numbers in the series.
Most authors start with `0, 1`, but some start with `1, 1` or `1, 2`.
It looks like this: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...`.

For this problem, you're asked to find the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers whose values do not exceed 4 million (4,000,000).
We can break this down in 3 steps:

1. Find all Fibonacci numbers below 4,000,000;
2. Filter out the odd numbers so you're left with the even numbers;
3. Sum all the numbers you're left with.

When coding, you can do these things one by one, but you could also do them all at once.
