# P003 - Largest Prime Factor
This problem is the first that requires a bit of mathematical thinking to have a solution that runs within milliseconds.
Each number can be written as a multiplication of prime numbers. Below you can see some examples:

```
7 = 1 * 7
12 = 2 * 2 * 3
25 = 5 * 5
99 = 3 * 3 * 11
```

As you can see, you can order the factors from smallest to largest. Why is that important?
Let's take 99 as an example:

```
99 / 3 = 33
33 / 3 = 11
```

By dividing by the smallest possible prime factor, we get a number that's smaller than our original number.
If we keep doing that, we will be left with a prime number.
And not just any prime number; it is the **largest prime factor** of our original number!
