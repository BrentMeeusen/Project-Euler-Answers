# P004 - Largest Palindrome Product
A palindrome number is one that's written the same forwards as it is backwards.
To find the largest palindromic number that is a product of two three-digit numbers, we will first have to do the multiplications.
Now, there might be some trick to filter some of the multiplications, but it's "only" 810,000 multiplications (900 * 900);
that shouldn't be any problem for any machine that isn't ancient.

With those results, we will have to do two things: filter out the palindromes, and find the largest one.
The fastest sorting algorithm I know is `O(n log n)`, whereas filtering can be done in `O(n)` time.
And, after filtering, we don't need to sort anymore, as we can simply find the largest value in the list of remaining values.
