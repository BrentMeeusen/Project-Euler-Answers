# P006 - Sum Square Difference
You are asked to find the difference between the sum of the squares and the squares of the sum for the first 100 natural numbers.
The sum of the squares is $1^2+2^2+...+n^2$, the square of the sum is $(1+2+...+n)^2$.
So, the easiest way to do this is to have one function for both calculations, and then running them and subtracting them to get the answer.
