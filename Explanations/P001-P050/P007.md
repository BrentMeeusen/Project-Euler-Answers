# P007 - 10 001st Prime
To find the 10 001st prime, the intuitive way is to write a loop that checks every single positive integer, and keeps track on how many primes have been found.
When you get to the 10 001st, return that number.
This approach can immediately be improved by starting at 3 and then incrementing by steps of 2, as all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd.
Note that you will have to start your prime counter at 1, in that case, because 2 is a prime number!
Having a helper function that checks if an integer is a prime number can be really helpful for this problem.
