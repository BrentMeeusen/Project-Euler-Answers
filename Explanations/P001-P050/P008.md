# P008 - Largest Product in a Series
You are given a 1000-digit number and your task is to find the greatest product of 13 adjacent digits.
Since the numbers have to be adjacent, we can loop over all the substrings of length 13, cast the individual characters to integers, and calculate the product.
The task is to find the maximum multiplication, so all we have to do is keep track of the largest product.
