# P009 - Special Pythagorean Triplet

A special Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, $a < b < c$, such that $a^2+b^2=c^2$.
For example, $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$.
The task is to find the one special Pythagorean triplet for which $a+b+c = 1000$, and to return the product $abc$.

We have two important constraints here.
First, $a+b+c = 1000$, and second, $a < b < c$.
We can use this information to limit the search space to make our algorithm more efficient.
We can loop over $a$ from 1 to 1000 (it will not reach that number because of $a < b < c$, but it will make sure we've
covered the entire search area), then loop over $b$ from $a + 1$ to 1000, and derive $c$ from that
with $c = 1000 - b - a$.
Since there's only one Pythagorean triplet where $a+b+c = 1000$, we can return $abc$ whenever $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
