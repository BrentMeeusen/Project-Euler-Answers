# P010 - Summation of Primes
You are asked to find the sum of all the primes below 2 million.
The challenge here is to write a function that finds all the primes below 2 million within a reasonable time frame.
A famous algorithm to achieve this is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
Then, return the sum of that result and you're done!
