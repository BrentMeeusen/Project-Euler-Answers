# P011 - Largest Product in a Grid
You are asked to find "the greatest product of four adjacent numbers in the same direction (...) in the $20 \times 20$
grid". Since we only have to find the maximum product, we can compute each combination for each square and return the
largest product.

You have to consider up, down, left, right, and diagonally. The example shows diagonally as top-left to bottom-right,
but from the description it's not clear whether it also includes the other direction. Tip: it makes a difference.

Since multiplication is the same in all directions (i.e. $ab = ba$), you have to traverse the matrix only once; there is
no need to check down if you have checked that combination as up before. So, if you traverse the matrix from top left to
bottom right, you only have to check in one direction (i.e. to the left or right, AND up or down, AND both diagonals in
one direction).
