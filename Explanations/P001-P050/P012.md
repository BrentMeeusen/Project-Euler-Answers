# P012 - Highly Divisible Triangular Number
The goal is to find the first triangle number with **more than** 500 divisors. The tricky part here is to design an
algorithm that finds the number of divisors quick enough.

Just like with calculating primes, we only need to calculate up to the square root. For some value $x$, we check for
each integer $1 \leq n \leq \sqrt{x}$ if $x \textrm{ mod } n = 0$. If so, we have found either 1 or 2 values. Because if
there is an integer product such that $x = ab$ and you know $a$, then you also know $b$. In this case, you don't need to
know $b$, you just need to know that it exists. There is an edge case, however, and that is when $a=b$ (
e.g., $3 \times 3 = 9$).
