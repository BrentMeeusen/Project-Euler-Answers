# P013 - Large Sum
You have to find the first 10 digits of 100 numbers with each 50 digits. Since a `long` can only support up to 19
digits, we cannot use default parameter types. You could use something like `BigInteger` when using Java, but there's
another way.

Remember how you'd add digits together in elementary school? First, you add all the digits in the first position, and
take some carry to the next column. You can apply the same principle here. Each time you compute the sum of a column,
you have found a new digit, and some carry for the next column. If you choose this method, you should remember that you
want to **prepend** to your final string, not **append** as is often the case.
