# P014 - Longest Collatz Sequence
The exercise explains what the Collatz sequence is. To compute the number of steps for each number might take a long
time, so we have to do something smart here. Instead of computing all the steps every time, we save the number of steps
it took for each number. So when we encounter that number again, we simply add that number of steps. For example, from 4
to 1 is 3 steps ($4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$). When we start from 8, we divide by 2 to get 4. Instead of going
through all those steps, we simply look up 4 and see that there will be 3 more steps. So, for 8 we can say it is 1
step (for starting at 8) + the 3 steps we know it's going to take when continuing at 4.

**Note:** these numbers can grow very large, very quickly. Indeed, in this problem, you will encounter numbers that
exceed the integer limit! So, if you are programming in a statically typed language, make sure to use `long`s for this
problem.
