# P015 - Lattice Paths
In this problem, you are asked to find the number of routes through a $20 \times 20$ grid when you can only move down
and right. Brute-forcing this is going to be a pain, and probably take an insane amount of time. There is a little math
trick here, though, to make things simpler.

Instead of looking at a grid of segments, let's look at a grid of nodes. For a grid of $n \times n$ line segments, we
need $(n + 1) \times (n + 1)$ nodes to represent that. The most outer lines, we can only visit in one way; only go
right, or only go down. If we look at $(1,1)$, we can get there two ways; down and right, and right and down. More
generally, we can reach $(x, y)$ by adding the number of ways to get to $(x - 1, y)$ and $(x, y - 1)$.

When you perform this process, you'll see that a pattern emerges. It is known as Pascal's Triangle. You might know the
formula to find a value in Pascal's triangle, it looks like this:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$$

Where $n$ is the number of rows (0-indexed; so 0 means the row looks like `1`, 1 means `1 1`, ...) and $k$ the column in
that row. Since it's a pyramid, $k \leq n$. Since we're looking for the most paths, we will always end up in the middle
of the pyramid. For an $x \times x$ grid, our pyramid has $2x$ rows. So, we can simply fill in the
formula: $\binom{2x}{x} = \frac{2x!}{(x!(2x - x)!}=\frac{2x!}{x!^2}$. And there you have it! You can solve this problem
without any coding whatsoever.
