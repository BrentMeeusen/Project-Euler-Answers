# Power Digit Sum
Just like in [P013](./P013.md), finding all digits of such a large number is difficult as we cannot represent it using
primitives like `int`s or `long`s. I don't know exactly how many digits are in $2^{1000}$, but every 10 powers of 2 is
another set of 3 digits ($2^{10}=1024$, $2^{20}=1048076$, ...), so I would guess that it has at least 300 digits. Now,
we can think of powers as a big multiplication ($2^4=2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2$), and multiplication as big
additions ($2 \times 4 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2$). So, a power is nothing but a massive number of additions. And we have already
written an algorithm to add large numbers written as strings, again in [P013](./P013.md)!

Let us start with the number 1 as a string (i.e. `"1"`). If we add that to itself, it is like
doing $1 \times 2=2^1 = 2$. If we now do the same for 2, we get $2 \times 2 = 2^2 = 4$. Then, $4 \times 2 = 2^3 = 8$.
See the pattern? More generally, if we repeat this process $n$ times, you'll
get $2^{n - 1} \times 2 = 2^{n - 1} \times 2^1 = 2^{n - 1 + 1} = 2^n$. So, if we repeat this process 1000 times, we
get $2^{1000}$ as a string. Then, all that's left is get all the individual digits and transforming them into integers.
Happy programming!
