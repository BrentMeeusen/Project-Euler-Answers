# P017 - Number Letter Counts
For this problem, we're supposed to count how many letters the numbers from 1-1000 have if we were to write them out.
There are specific rules given to how they are written out (i.e. no spaces or hyphens, with "and"). One solution can be
to write a program that for a certain set of substrings (e.g., "hundred", "one", "twenty") multiplies its length by its
number of occurrences. The latter can be a hardcoded value as the problem only calls for one answer. Choosing the set of
substrings and reasoning about the number of occurrences for each of them is then the challenge in this problem.

You can also choose to write a script that computes each number as a word, then map to the lengths and return the sum.
Or, you could do all that in one go; write an algorithm that given a number will calculate how long the length of the
string will be without constructing the string. There are many ways you can solve this problem, but it can be difficult
to know where you're wrong when ProjectEuler does not accept your answer, as there are a couple of edge cases, and to me
there is no real intuition as to what the answer should approximately be.
