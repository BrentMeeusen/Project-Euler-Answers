# P018 - Maximum Path Sum I
We're given a triangle, and we're supposed to find the way down that maximises the sum of the route. As is written in
the problem description, there are only 16384 routes in this pyramid, so brute-forcing it is definitely an option.
However, a later problem will do the same thing but with a bigger pyramid (it will have 100 rows). So, solving this
properly here will also solve the one for P067.

The trick here is to not go from the top down, but work from the bottom up. Leave the bottom row as-is. Then, for each
row (remember: bottom-up) you check for each cell what its highest value can be. It will be the value in the original
pyramid, plus the maximum value of its two children. If you keep repeating this process, you end up with a pyramid where
the maximum path is in the top cell.

If you want to brute-force this solution, you'll probably end up doing a depth-first search (DFS) through the pyramid.
Writing the code for this can be a fun challenge, but be aware that it's not the efficient route, and it will not help
you solve P067. But, of course, that is a different problem ;).
