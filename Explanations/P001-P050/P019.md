# P019 - Counting Sundays
For this problem, a bit of information is given about leap years and the structure of the calendar regarding number of
days per month. Now, one way is to simulate each day from the moment we have knowledge of (i.e. 1 January 1900). Instead
of that, though, we can also simulate entire months at a time, as we're only interested in seeing how often a Sunday
occurs at the start of a month, not a week.

Using the modulo operator, we can find what day of the week it should be after the month has passed. Other than that,
some loops will do the trick to go over all the years and months for which we want to count the Sundays on the first of
the month.
