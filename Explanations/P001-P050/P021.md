# P021 - Amicable Numbers
The description gives a clear explanation on what amicable numbers are. To compute (the sum of) the amicable numbers, we
can write a function that calculates $d(n)$ as defined in the assignment, then call that function when we're looping
over the numbers from 1 to 10 000. You can choose to keep a list of amicable numbers, or add it directly to the sum each
time you've found an amicable number.
