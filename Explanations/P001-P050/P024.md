# P024 - Lexicographical Permutations
This is another problem which you can solve without writing any code. Solve the problem with code, then head to the
forum and `Ctrl+F` for "No code for this one too" or "explained by euler", and try to understand (one of) the
explanations.

When using code, multiple approaches exist. I chose to work with recursion. When we have only two digits (say $a$
and $b$), there are only 2 permutations possible, namely $ab$ and $ba$. Now, consider 3 digits, $abc$. We can make 3
sets of 2 digits ($ab$, $ac$, $bc$) for which we can compute the 2 possible permutations. Then adding the leftover digit
to each of these in front will give you all the permutations for 3 digits. With 4 digits, it's the same process; first
compute for 3 digits, then add the digit you left out in front, and there you have it: all permutations for 4 digits!
