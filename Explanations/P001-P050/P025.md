# P025 - 1000-digit Fibonacci Number
The Fibonacci sequence is a matter of adding numbers together. Similar to the [P020](./P020.md) problem, the numbers
will be too large to be stored as an integer or long, so we will again revert to the string-based solution we developed
earlier. The Fibonacci sequence is typically used to learn about recursion. However, in this case, you will probably run
into a Stackoverflow error. So, instead we will use a loop-based approach.
