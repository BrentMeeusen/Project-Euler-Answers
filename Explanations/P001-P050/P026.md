# P026 - Reciprocal Cycles
This one I thought was tricky. I compute the cycle length by keeping track of all the remainders that I've seen so far.
If we've seen the current remainder at some point already, return the current position minus the recorded occurrence to
get the length of the repetition. If it doesn't exist, record the current remainder and index, compute the next
remainder ($x = (x \times 10) \mod n$) and repeat until a hit is found.
