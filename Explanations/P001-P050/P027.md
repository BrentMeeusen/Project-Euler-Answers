# P027 - Quadratic Primes
The description is a bit more complex compared to previous descriptions, but the question itself is relatively easy to
answer once you've dissected the requirements. For the formula $n^2 + an + b$ with $|a| < 1000$ and $|b| \leq 1000$,
compute how many consecutive primes you can find, starting from 0. So, for all valid pairs of $a$ and $b$, calculate the
outcome for each value of $n$ starting at $n = 0$, until the outcome is no longer prime. Save the longest streak, as
well as what $a$ and $b$ made that streak happen. Finally, return $a \times b$ and you're done!
