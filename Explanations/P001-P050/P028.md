# P028 - Number Spiral Diagonals
The idea of this problem is quite simple, and is clearly explained. Writing the code to solve it can be a bit more
tricky, though. One option is to write an algorithm that fills a 2D array (or a 1D array that uses one integer to
indicate its $x$ and $y$ position) according to the description, and then calculate the sum of the diagonals. Be careful
not to count the middle twice, if that's the approach you're going for!

I adapted the algorithm to not use an array. Instead, I detect if we're at a corner, and if so, we add it to the sum and
continue spiraling (usually not a good thing, but a requirement in this case).
