# P029 - Distinct Powers
This is again a problem that is relatively simple to understand. There are multiple ways to solve this, but to me, the
most intuitive solution is to loop over all combinations of $a$ and $b$, calculate both $a^b$ and $b^a$, and add them to
a set (because a set has no duplicates by definition). Then, return the size of the set and that's your answer.
