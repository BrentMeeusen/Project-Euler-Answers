# P030 - Digit Fifth Powers
The problem description is quite clear, but it may also introduce a misconception as to how these digits are built. The
example uses fourth power digits, and coincidentally, the only numbers that can be written as the sum of the fourth
power of their digits are numbers with 4 digits. This is not the case for the fifth power, however. There are numbers
that are not 5 digits long, yet can be written as the sum of the fifth power of all digits. With this knowledge, writing
the algorithm to find the answer is relatively straightforward.
